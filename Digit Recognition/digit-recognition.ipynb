    "# Digit Recognition\n",
    "digitrec.py is a Python script that takes an image file containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a supervised learning algorithm. This will be done using the MNIST dataset to train and test the neural network. This script uses [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), a high level neural network API. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Digit Dataset\n",
    "First things first, we need to open and read the MNIST dataset. This has already been covered in the [MNIST dataset notebook](https://github.com/HUGHBRADY/Emerging_Tech/blob/master/MNIST%20Dataset/mnist-dataset.ipynb) in this repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Keras \n",
    "We also need to set up our neural network. Keras' core data structure is a model, which is a way to organize layers. The simpliest of these models is the Sequential model so it's the perfect one to start learning with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Sequential model is a linear stack of layers. The first layer is used to define the input shape for the other layers. "
