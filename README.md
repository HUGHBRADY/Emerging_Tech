## Requirements

We were required to write the following four notebooks and one python script using jupyter notebook:

### numpy random notebook - 
   A jupyter notebook explaining the concepts behind and the use of the numpy random package, including plots of the various distributions.
### Iris dataset notebook -
   A jupyter notebook explaining the famous iris data set including the difficulty in writing an algorithm to separate the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset.
### MNIST dataset notebook -
   A jupyter notebook explaining how to read the MNIST dataset efficiently into memory in Python.
### Digit recognition script -
   A Python script that takes an image file containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a supervised learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset.
### Digit recognition notebook -
   A jupyter notebook explaining how the above Python script works and discussing its performance.

   
## How to Run 
Download git to your machine if not already installed.
Download and install Anaconda. This will install all of the python packages and jupyter needed to run the files in this repository.
To clone the repository type the following command in the terminal while you are in your desired location for the repository contents.

>git clone https://github.com/HUGHBRADY/Emerging_Tech/

To get the last 2 notebooks to work you will have to create a new folder called "data" inside your folder and store the image files there.
